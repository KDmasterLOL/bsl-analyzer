//! How far a reference walk got, read from the span `ide` already emits.
//!
//! `ide::references` opens a `find_references_in_file` span per file, so a cancellation
//! gate can learn that a walk has started — and how many files it entered — without a
//! `sleep` and without a counter in production code. The price is that the subscriber
//! and the counter are process-global: every test in a binary that walks references
//! adds to the same number. A test that reads it must therefore serialise against every
//! other test in its binary that can move it — a gate mutex owned by that test crate —
//! else [`await_walk_start`] returns on somebody else's file and the gate measures an
//! interleaving instead of a cancellation.
