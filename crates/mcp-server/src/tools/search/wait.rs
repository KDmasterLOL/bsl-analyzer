//! Waiting on behalf of one request, with the request's cancellation as a way out.

//! Two things on the search path answer through a channel from another thread: the
//! baseline actor and the query embedder. Neither can be interrupted from outside —
//! the actor is mid-way through a synchronous PostgreSQL query, the embedder inside a
//! blocking HTTP call — but the CALLER can stop waiting: it drops its receiver, the
//! answer lands on nobody, and whatever the caller held (the engine guard, its place
//! in the request) is released by ordinary return. The producer finishes its current
//! work on its own and reads nothing back.
