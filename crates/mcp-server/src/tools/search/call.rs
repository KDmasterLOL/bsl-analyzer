//! The one door a search request goes through.
//!
//! Sibling of `resident_call`: the body runs on a blocking thread under the rmcp
//! per-request token, and the outcome is rendered by the same `cancellable_answer` as every
//! other tool. The difference is how the signal reaches the body. The resident door fans
//! it out to salsa tokens and lets an in-flight query unwind; a search body has no query to
//! unwind and a `std::sync::Mutex` guard that an unwind would poison, so it observes a clone
//! of the token itself and returns [`SearchFailure::Cancelled`] from its next cooperative
//! point — a value, not a panic.
