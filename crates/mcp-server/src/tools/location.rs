//! The location contract: one shape for "where" and one shape for "how fresh and how
//! complete", shared by every agent-facing tool.
//!
//! Before this module each tool spelled a place its own way — 1-based lines here,
//! 0-based ranges there, a bare line number in a third, nothing at all in a fourth — and
//! a consumer had to know which tool it was talking to before it could read an answer.
//! The rule that keeps that from coming back: this module is the ONLY place that
//! serializes a location or a freshness envelope. A tool assembles the typed value and
//! hands it over; it never writes the keys itself.
