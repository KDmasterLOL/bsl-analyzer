//! What every file-addressed tool has to agree on: how a `(root_id, path)` pair names a
//! file, which pair the answer carries back, and what a failure to reach the file is called.
//!
//! The pair is the key, so two tools that read it differently address different files while
//! reporting the same address — a wrong answer wearing the shape of a right one. The rules
//! live here once rather than in each tool, and the vocabulary of failures is shared for the
//! same reason: `diagnostics file` and `outline` answering one input with two different codes
//! would make the codes stop being a vocabulary.
//!
//! What is deliberately NOT shared is the prose. Each tool's `detail` describes what THAT
//! tool does with a file it cannot serve — the resident holds an unreadable file out of
//! service and re-reads it every drift window, a one-shot parse does neither — so the text
//! stays at the call site and only the code comes from here.
