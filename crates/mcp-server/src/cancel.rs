//! Cancellation of one MCP request.
//!
//! `rmcp` hands every tool handler a per-request [`tokio_util::sync::CancellationToken`],
//! cancelled on `notifications/cancelled` and on transport shutdown. That token lives on
//! the async side; the work it has to reach runs on a blocking thread, often deep inside
//! Salsa queries. [`RequestCancel`] is the bridge between the two.
//!
//! It carries the signal in both forms a worker can observe:
//!
//! - a flag, for loops that are between queries and have nothing to unwind from;
//! - the Salsa cancellation tokens of the per-request database handles, so an in-flight
//!   query unwinds at its next query boundary through the `unwind_if_revision_cancelled`
//!   checkpoints the analysis layers already carry.
//!
//! Registration and cancellation share one mutex, so a worker registering after the
//! cancel request has its token cancelled on the spot — there is no window in which a
//! late worker runs to completion. Only the tokens handed to this request are cancelled:
//! a handle clone carries its own token, so the resident's master handle and every
//! concurrent request stay untouched.
