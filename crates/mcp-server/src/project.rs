//! The one place this crate turns a workspace path into a [`Project`].
//!
//! A source set given on the command line is not on disk, so a call that only
//! receives a root path cannot see it. That matters here more than elsewhere:
//! the crate re-derives the project from a bare path in a dozen places — graph
//! scans, freshness checks, drift identity, the resident diagnostics host, the
//! broker key — and none of them can reach `SharedState`. Threading a spec
//! through every one of them would mean widening a dozen signatures whose
//! callers do not know about source sets either.
//!
//! Instead the override is process state, set once from argv before anything
//! builds a project, and consulted here. A server process serves exactly one
//! workspace with exactly one source set for its whole life, so there is nothing
//! for a second value to belong to. The scope stays inside this crate:
//! `project-model` gains no global, and `Project::new` keeps meaning what it
//! says everywhere else.

/// It lives beside [`at`] for the same reason [`at`] does: more than one subsystem needs the
/// table, and two of them — the search engine and the diagnostics resident — must agree on it
/// exactly. Agreement that follows from calling one constructor cannot drift; agreement between
/// two constructors is a claim someone has to keep true.
///
/// Rejected roots come back rather than being logged here. Whether a dropped root is worth a
/// line depends on how often the caller runs: the boot builds this once, while the resident
/// rebuilds on every config drift, and a warning repeated per rebuild buries the one that is
/// actually new. Callers that run once say it with [`warn_about_rejected_roots`].
///
/// **No structural test forbids a second hand-built root set anywhere in this crate, and
/// that is a decision.** Such a test can only scan source text, and telling a call from a
/// mention — or from a longer identifier ending in the same name — is Rust's lexical
/// grammar, which a text scan approximates and never matches. The accessor used as a
/// function value, a comment standing between the name and its parenthesis, a parenthetical
/// aside in prose: each falls on a different side of whatever line the scan draws, and
/// moving the line to admit one form expels another. What guards each root set instead is
/// behavioural, and each set has its own: this table has a boot test, so has the graph's scan
/// universe, and the hub's declared targets are read back on a second boot over a matching
/// graph cache — the one boot path that leaves them alone (see `state::bootstrap`).
