//! What the server puts on the wire in answer to a real client's `initialize`.
//!
//! Every other session test drives the server with our own client from the same transport
//! library, so both ends agree on whatever the library currently does and a change in
//! negotiation is invisible: the two sides move together. This gate replays the exact
//! frames two shipping clients send — captured from live handshakes with the versions
//! named below — and pins the answer.
//!
//! Two of the frames are offers the server supports, and answering them is
//! indistinguishable from echoing them back: both revisions are known, so a server that
//! never consulted its own list would look identical on either. The third frame is what
//! separates the two — it offers a revision no build supports, where negotiation falls back
//! to the server's own and blind echo does not. Without it this gate would catch a server
//! pinned to a single revision and nothing else.
