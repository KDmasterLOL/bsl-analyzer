//! Diagnostics for a query text that is not embedded in a module.
//!
//! The rules are the same ones a query inside a `.bsl` string literal gets — same codes,
//! same severities, same parameters — because they are the same functions. What differs is
//! only where the ranges land and where the metadata comes from: a caller with no file
//! passes a resolver directly instead of letting Salsa derive one from a `FileId`.
