# Variable is assigned to itself (SelfAssign)

## Description

Assigning a variable or property to itself has no effect and usually indicates a typo or a mistaken copy-paste edit.

The current implementation is narrow and HIR-based:

- it reports assignments where the left and right sides resolve to the same path;
- matching is case-insensitive, because BSL identifiers are case-insensitive;
- simple property self-assignments such as `Object.Field = Object.Field` are also reported.

## Examples

### Incorrect

```bsl
Amount = Amount;
Structure.Field = Structure.Field;
```

### Correct

```bsl
Amount = TotalAmount;
Structure.Field = NewValue;
```
