# Access to an unknown field (UnresolvedField)

<!-- Блоки выше заполняются автоматически, не трогать -->
## Description

The diagnostic reports field access on an expression whose type is known well enough for the analyzer to say that the requested field does not exist.

This usually means one of the following:

- the field name contains a typo;
- the code expects a different metadata object type;
- the expression can be `Undefined` or of another type, but the current code does not reflect that explicitly.

The current implementation is conservative. It reports only cases where type inference has a confident metadata reference type and the field lookup fails for that type.

## Examples

Incorrect:

```bsl
Ref = CommonModule.GetCatalogRef();
Name = Ref.UnknownField;
```

Correct:

```bsl
Ref = CommonModule.GetCatalogRef();
Name = Ref.Description;
```
