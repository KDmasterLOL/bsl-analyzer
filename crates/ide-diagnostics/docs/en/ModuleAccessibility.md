# Access to user code unavailable in the execution environment (ModuleAccessibility)

## Description

User code, like the platform API, is not uniformly available across execution environments. The diagnostic reports two kinds of violations:

- **Calling a common module from an environment it is not compiled for.** A server common module without the "Server call" flag cannot be invoked from client code; a client common module does not exist on the server. A module with the "Server call" flag IS callable from the client — that is the regular remote call and is not reported.
- **Calling a local method across compilation directives.** Code running on the server cannot invoke a method behind `&AtClient` — the symbol does not exist there. The opposite direction (a client form method calling an `&AtServer` method) is the form's regular remote server call and is not reported. In a managed form module a call through `ЭтотОбъект`/`ЭтаФорма` is the same local call and is judged identically to the bare one.

The call site's environment set is computed exactly as for `UnavailableInEnvironment`: module environments ∩ compilation directive ∩ preprocessor `#If` narrowing (including regions around whole methods). The message qualifier lists only the violating environments — mirroring 1C:EDT verdicts "Module 'X' is not accessible at client" and "Procedure 'X' is not defined [Server]".

The callee module's flags come from the configuration visible to the caller: an extension that adopts the module replaces its flags wholesale, so "Server call" enabled in the extension silences the diagnostic for that extension's code.

Limitations (deliberately conservative): extension interceptors (`&Instead`/`&Before`/`&After`, `&ChangeAndValidate`) are not checked; calls through a variable holding a module value (`M = Common.CommonModule("Name"); M.Method()`) are not checked — control flow selects the module dynamically; the mobile client, the external connection, and the legacy thick client (ordinary application) are excluded from the checked environment set by default; the ordinary-application client contributes to module environments only when ordinary application support is enabled.

## Configuration

The checked environment set is the `checked_environments` list in the `[features]` section of `bsl-analyzer.toml`, shared with `UnavailableInEnvironment`; see that diagnostic's documentation for details and an example.

## Examples

Incorrect:

```bsl
// CommonModule.ServerSide: Server = True, ServerCall = False
&AtClient
Procedure Save()
    ServerSide.Write(); // the module is not accessible at client
EndProcedure
```

```bsl
&AtClient
Procedure Show()
EndProcedure

&AtServer
Procedure Process()
    Show(); // the procedure is not defined on the server
EndProcedure
```

Correct:

```bsl
// CommonModule.ServerSideServerCall: Server = True, ServerCall = True
&AtClient
Procedure Save()
    ServerSideServerCall.Write(); // the regular remote call
EndProcedure
```
