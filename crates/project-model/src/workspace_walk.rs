//! Walking a workspace's source roots under one explicit policy.

//! Every place that enumerates the working tree — the graph's file universe, the
//! topology fingerprint, the search overlay, the boot reconcile — has to agree on
//! what a source file is, whether links are followed and what an incomplete walk
//! means. This module owns that policy; callers own identity: it deliberately does
//! not attribute a file to a root and does not de-duplicate, because the store keys
