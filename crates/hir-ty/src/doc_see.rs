//! Types a slot documented as `см. Модуль.Метод` by reading the documentation it points at.
//!
//! The 1C convention writes a structure once and refers to it everywhere else:
//!
//! ```text
//! // Параметры:
//! //   Параметры - см. ОбщегоНазначенияКлиентСервер.ПараметрыЗаписи
//! ```
//!
//! Answering what such a slot holds needs the target module, so it cannot happen where the
//! signature is lowered — that path is pure, cheap and shared by every call site. It happens here
//! instead, memoised per referring method, and only IDE consumers read it.
//!
//! Two properties this module exists to keep:
//!
//! **Acyclic in salsa.** The query never calls itself. A chain `см. → см. → …` is walked by
//! [`Driver`] with its own visited set, exactly as [`crate::structure_param_keys`] does, so a
//! caller that is itself a fixpoint (inference) reads a settled value.
//!
//! **Documentation only.** The recursion runs on `&dyn SeeTargets` and `&dyn TypeKernelDb`.
//! Neither offers inference, so a target's body cannot be read from here — not by convention, but
//! because the call does not compile. Keys a body proves are out of scope by that same boundary.
